Coding Tasks:

1. Create a menu (designed to work well on mobile) - the menu should have a show hide button and allows the user to adjust settings whilst seeing the animation.
 - The menu should have a slider to adjust the number of cubes.
 - The menu should allow user to select the from the following color schemes:
  - Random
  - Rainbow
  - All cubes the same colour - with added option to allow the user to select the colour.

2. Add tests to test the application (ideally also the UI).

3. Update the README.md file to include the new features.
